__cekickafa__ : üëã  @scilio

__defistaker__ : üëã Maybe @scilio thought that meeting was at 15:00 CET.

__cekickafa__ : it writes there 10 UTC. And yesterday reminded here also. 
Maybe 10.00 UTC time is not suitable for meeting. We can reconsider it.

__dtavarez__ : the original idea of having a meeting at 10 utc was for a change and to give others the opportunity to join in.

üëç cekickafa

__anynomous__ : üëã

__phyro__ : Regarding coinswap review, I thought I'd go through today, but things came in and will do that tomorrow.

üëç cekickafa, johndavies

__scilio__ : sorry for my absence. I converted the time wrong. 10 utc is middle of the night for me, so I didn't see the notifications until now.

It's not WIP. I was just adding in more test coverage and comments while I waited for reviewers. I was hoping that would make it easier to review.

__cekickafa__ : Next meeting ,2 weeks later 16 august. at 15.00 UTC time. Hope it matches you @scilio and you  can join.

__scilio__ : I can do that. Hopefully @phyro, @dtavarez and @yeastplume can finish reviewing by then

* __anynomous__ : As we can see there are only two agenda point for today, discuss the mining and vote on the purchase of mining equipment
@mcmmike contacted NHash and got the following response. You can read it all to know what we are voting on in the second agenda point.

    I got a reply from nHash:

        Hi Mike,

        Glad to know we can cooperate with the Grin community.
        As you required 12 units G1 mini and 1 unit G1, here we quote below:
        G1 mini 1.2Gps ±10%： $799/unit
        G1 36Gps±10%：$23,999/unit
        Shipping cost to Germany by UPS, 5~8 working days, $547.
        Total $34,134

        This is the best price we can offer for you and Grin community members.
        Please arrange the miners payment and shipping cost to separatly address:
        Paying $33587 to below:

        Await your reply.

        Regards,
        NHASH support
        

    So in summary we get a nice discount, THX to NHash sponsoring the Community council a bit, we are thank-full for that.
    For the time being we can discuss Agenda point 
    1) Discussion of community feedback and formal plan for community mining.

* __defistaker__ : What is the regular price for G1 mini?

* __anynomous__ : Normal price of the previous batch (which is sold out), was \\$899, but they go online for prices up to \\$2000

    So I am not certain what the normal price is for the latest batch but I think it save to assume the price is 1000$ at least for a single unit, so without batch discount. If any one has more up to date information, please share.

    I am unfortunately short on time, so I will already provide my vote for agenda point 2)
I would wholeheartedly like to vote in favour of buying the mining equipment for the price shown in the message above:hand:.

* __defistaker__ : I am voting in favour too

* __anynomous__ : Regarding making an official plan for the community mining, I think we do not have a full plan yet, here are some suggestions:
    - Pay electricity prices on a quarterly basis using a month average in Grin to the community miners.
    - Regarding the G1 location, I might be able to get a place in Belgium with electricity prices of 8-10 cents. They offer for 8 for larger scale, but they might be so kind to offer it for our single unit as a way of sponsoring, still need to contact them.

* __future3000__ : That sounds good re elec cost. Imo we really need to bring the cost down close to 10 cents/kw to stay competitive in the future. 

* __anynomous__ : I think I can offer to provide exposure to their sponsoring, so that maybe others might use their location for mining equipment in exchange for making an exception of accepting a single miner.

    Would that be acceptable for everyone, to make such an offer, a bit similar to how NHash supporst/sponsors the community?

    Please indicate with thumbs up or down.

    ( __cekickafa__, __defistaker__ ,  __anynomous__,  __dtavarez__,  __future3000__,  __dtavarez__ responded with thumb up)

* __anynomous__ : Thx

* __anynomous__ : Of course, if there are alternative locations with good electricity price, we should consider those as well. But in case there are no good alternatives, I  think it is a solid plan.

* __anynomous__ : I have to go now, I will read up later on any suggestions for setting up the mining, maybe @ __future3000__ can go over points discussed on the forum, so we can already discuss how to take the points given into account. Just a suggestion though, feel free to shape the discussion differently :smile:

* __dtaverez__ : 
    >Pay electricity prices on a quarterly basis using a month average in Grin to the community miners
    
    what would it be the simplest way to do this? can we pay using grin? 

* __anynomous__ : Each miner can withdraw it himsel, but we do need to account this publicly.

* __future3000__ : Yeah should definitely be paid in Grin. 

* __dtavarez__ : I think we said that we will withdraw everything to the CC public Grin wallet, right?

* __future3000__ : Could be based on a 30day moving average of Grin/usd 

    (__cekickafa__,  __defistaker__,  __dtavarez__ thumb up)

* __dtavarez__ : makes sense to me

* __future3000__ :
    
    - CC miners must confirm their avg electric $ per kw- Which they will be paid a USD equivalent of Grin in each month
    
    - CC miners must send all their Grin rewards to a public Grin wallet. 
    
    - At end of each month CC miners are paid their total electric cost for the month from the public Grin wallet, based on a 30-day moving average of GRIN/USD. 

    (__defistaker__,  __dtavarez__,  __cekickafa__ thumb up)

* __cekickafa__ : yes,there wont be much friction imo. nice plan:+1:

* __future3000__ : we also need to confirm who from CC will be allocated the G1s and how many units they will be allocated( 12x G1 mini & 1 x G1). We also need to factor in additional shipping costs( since the price quoted from Nhash is only to Germany). 

    Further more;  for the G1, we really need to find somewhere to host it with reasonable elec costs( circa 10c/kw). 
    As pointed out on the forums: "Most of the CC are based in Europe where electricity can be upwards of 0.35 \\$/kWh, where in the US 0.12 can be fairly common.

    - 2800w @ 0.35 \\$/kWh is going to cost \\$8590 per year
    - 2800w @ 0.12 \\$/kWh is going to cost \\$2945 per year

* __dtavarez__ : now I think, the identities should remain private, we don't know the future repercussions. 
because all the madness around crypto lately 

* __future3000__ : That is a good point.  We still need to confirm this internally though. 

* __dtavarez__ : yes.

* __future3000__ : Then we can explain the allocation publicly- eg 12x G1 mini's are being allocated to 4x CC members.

* __defistaker__ : __anynomous__ mentioned, he is looking into a place in belgium with 0.10 cents power cost

* __future3000__ : Yes, this sounds ideal.
I can currently get good electric rates, $0.10/kw. But I don’t want to put my hand up for it, because I can’t guarantee how long I can get those rates for.   

* __defistaker__ : 

    - CC miners must confirm their avg electric $ per kw- Which they will be paid a USD equivalent of Grin in each month

    - CC miners must send all their Grin rewards to a public Grin wallet. 
    
    - At end of each month CC miners are paid their total electric cost for the month from the public Grin wallet, based on a 30-day moving average of GRIN/USD. 

     - __anynomous__ will get in contact in a datacenter with 8-10 cents power cost for G1 in exchange for exposure for them so that other miners can use their facilities.

    - Identities that running mining equipment will not be disclosed in public for privacy concerns ( this will be discussed internally in council)

* __defistaker__ : This is the summary of today's meeting notes/decisions.

* __dtavarez__ :  the energy cost for G1 mini miners will be paid in grin based on a 30day moving average of Grin/usd

                    {`__dtavarez__ : Hello! One minute to review the agenda https://github.com/grincc/agenda/issues/61

if anyone has other suggestions, now is the time
suggestions for today's agenda.


__deeev__ : Whats the deal with grin testnet? Block production is unstable?


__dtavarez__ : 3 things.

1- Seeders

2- Faucet

3- just make sure we keep mining Testnet

__phyro__ : so what's the topic of discussion now, the seeders first?

__yeastplume__ : we have a list of seed nodes. I was going to merge them into the next alpha release (but I'd like the couple of outstanding issues that are filling up resource descriptiors or causing nodes to stop to be addressed first(

 üëç phyro

__phyro__ : there was also one PR opened https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3710

__yeastplume__ : sure, but I'm going to run through the list closer to release time and test them all

üëç dtavarez

__phyro__ : yes, i agree.

__MCMMike__ : 
>_yeastplume__ : we have a list of seed nodes. I was going to merge them into the next alpha release (but I'd like the couple of outstanding issues that are filling up resource descriptiors or causing nodes to stop to be addressed first(

you mean the mainnet seed nodes or testnet , as we from Grinnode will provide some relyable test-nodes soon as well. 
We are already in the DNS seed for mainnet and could provide some stable nodes for testnet also
btw üëã

üëã cekickafa, deeev

__yeastplume__ : nodes for both testnet and mainnet
will be changed/updated on the next release
https://grintools.revcore.net/seedcheck

And at the moment, there are no working testnet seeds at all
I can test and merge what we have into main anyhow so at least those building from source and testing will have it. We just want to make sure the list is finalised before the next release.

__dtavarez__ : We could ask again in the forum for seeders
but as long as the seeders shipped in the code works, we should be fine.

__phyro__ : as far as I understand, the seeds hardcoded in the last release don't work, you'd have to modify the code with new seeds (e.g. from the PR above), build it and then it would work.

__dtavarez__ : what amount of seeders do you think should be included? 5? 4?

__phyro__ : I don't have a strong opinion on this, 5 sounds good

__yeastplume__ : as many as we can get.

__dtavarez__ : that's then a goal.

__yeastplume__ : 5 sounds like a good goal

__dtavarez__ : awesome :) next... the Faucet...
last time I checked the faucet run by Quenntin was not running.
I think it would be good to have one running.

__cekickafa__ : @hendi was running a one?

__phyro__ : haven't used the faucet for a long time so don't know if it's working now or not. It's definitely good to have one available.

__dtavarez__ : I think we could continue to encourage the community to test heavily the wallet and the node.
last time I checked it was not working.
what I want to achieve is a healthy testnet playground.
last time we ran a QA "campaign" as a success I think we would need to do it again soon. The more eyes the better. And having a healthy testnet is the first step IMO.

üíØ mo5itoo

__cekickafa__ : well, it became weird when there is 2 meeting simultanously i think:)

__dtavarez__ : to wrap up this one; the minimum amount seeders (testnet) to be hardcoded is then 5.
thank you for your time.
I'm out üëã

__yeastplume__ : woah, no we're not hardcoding a number of seeders, we're aiming for at least 5
if we don't have 5 we don't have 5.
sorry, read that as 'hardcoding 5 as the number of seeders'

__cekickafa__ : So the action point is to have at least 5 seed nodes.

__yeastplume__ : a goal, if possible

üëç cekickafa, dtavarez.

__cekickafa__ :  There is open discussion, has anybody words? or end meeting for note keeping?
ok. thank you all üëã

 * __cekickafa__ : 
 > __anynomous__ - "Paouky has informed us that due to lack of time he wants to step down as the Community Council (CC) 6th member. Paouky has helped setup and kick-off the council, which we fellow council members are very grateful for. We respect and understand his decision to give his seat to someone who has more time available and we hope to still see him around active in this project when time allows him." 
 * __defistaker__ : It seems there are 3 candidates right now and deadline is 30 April
 * __phyro__ : we probably won't get an update on the progress on this unless there's someone from CC around... does this mean 1 of the multisig keys is missing at the moment or is paouky still around in case it's needed?
 * __anynomous__ : Yes, we will let Paouky keep the key and only switch to a new wallet if another member would switch. We took into account various security considerations and think this would be best.. So, the new council member will get Paouky's key, but Pauuky keeps a backup.
 * __anynomous__ : Started the election of the Grin CC 6th council member since Pauoky is stepping down:(https://forum.grin.mw/t/community-council-election-for-the-6th-cc-member/9698/7)
 * __defistaker__ : So what are responsibilities of a CC member, for people considering to apply?
 * __anynomous__ : CC members have the responsibility to 1) securely manage the key, keep a backup of it. 2) Be available for signing and for votes on spending's. 3) Preferably also some time to commit to it, since being a council member does take time, and the more active members we have, the better we can share the burdens and joys...  I will polish that post a bit later today adding the rules and more specifically the tasks. Since yes, it is a commitment.
 * __phyro__ : __@defistaker__ are you considering volunteering for a position in CC?
 * __defistaker__ : No, I asked for common knowledge `}

may be worth pinging them on the forum as well

 * __anynomous__ : Something that I personal would like to dedicate some time on is to make it easier for community members to see where to start with developing. I added a section for it on thee Grin CC Hub, but after thinking about it more, I think we need to make a separate page on it altogether. E.g. list all the projects and their programming languages and frameworks, like @dtavarez did here:(https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-development-libraries/8735/11?u=anynomous).. Also I would like to create a flowchart/UML diagram of the node and wallet. Make it easier for people to understand the flow of the code.
 * __defistaker__ : That would be great
 * __anynomous__ : When I say people, I am ofcourse also talking about myself. I would like to understand the code better, so I can be of some useðŸ˜› Also, I am working on a script to generate wallets using Python from either a mnemonic (using word list and checksum), or any other entropy, direct conversion to entropy bits of whatever the user feeds it, I assume a string.

But my plans were for the Netherlands. There are also plans for Berlin and somewhere near London I think by others... Would be great to have some physical meetings again.
 * __phyro__ : Regarding physical attendance, it would make sense if enough people would gather. Not sure what the state of this is today.
 * __anynomous__ :  I have to go in 1-2 minute. So sorry, I will read when I get back later today.
